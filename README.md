# Project overview:
* DSL language created with **TextX**.
* GUI created with **Python** and **tkinter**.
# Main idea
Main idea for this project is to create domain specific language with textX and python which will speed up the process of creating and generating code.
User just need to learn syntax (help window will be created inside GUI). Syntax is more human oriented and it will make life easier for developers.
At the beggining, DSL will generate Java classes but it can be extended for Python and C# programming languages.
## What you get with this DSL:
* Automatization
* Time efficiency in coding and deployment
* Less coding syntax errors
* Standardization and consistency
## Visualisation:
* .dot (meta model and model)
* PlantUML (meta model)
## Functionalities:
### With this DSL you will be able to create:
* **Parameters** (for every parameter you will be able to generate get/set methods).
* For every parameters you will be able to generate different **data types** (basic and advanced). For all advanced data types DSL will be able to generate **imports** too.
* **Constants**
* **Constructors** (Default, Empty, and with specific parameters)
* **Functions** (void and return). Logic of the functions should be written manually.
# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION:
Here I will write all the important information and pictures related to the course of project development...
