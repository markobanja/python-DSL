# Project overview:
# Main idea
Main idea for this project is to create domain specific language with textX and python which will be used for editing collection of images and thus speed up the process of desired changes of images.
# Image editing
Image editing implies:

Functionalities               | 
----------------------------- | 
Rotate                        | 
Zoom                          |  
Compress                      |
Etc...                        |

which will be triggered and applied to a collection of images by giving commands with our language specifically defined for this domain.
